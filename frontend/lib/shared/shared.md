# shared
The "shared" folder contains components, resources, or utilities that are shared and used across multiple features or throughout the application.

It often includes files that define shared styles, themes, colors, constants, or routes.

This folder helps maintain consistency and code reuse by centralizing shared elements that are accessed by different parts of the application.
