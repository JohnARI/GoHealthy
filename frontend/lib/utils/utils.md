# utils
The "utils" folder provides utility classes or functions that offer generic functionalities used across the application.

It often includes files that handle common tasks or encapsulate reusable logic.

This folder is suitable for placing code that doesn't belong to a specific feature but provides helpful functionalities, such as handling API exceptions or providing secure storage capabilities.
