# features
The f"eatures" folder represents a modular structure where each feature corresponds to a specific functionality or user-facing section of the app.

It is a container for grouping related files based on the app's features or modules. Within this folder, you would typically find subfolders for each feature, such as authentication or home.

Each subfolder may contain files such as blocs (state management), data models, repositories (data access layer), pages (UI components), and widgets specific to that feature.
